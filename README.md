# Home Lab

Declarative infrastructure for my home lab.

Stack:

| Category | Tool |
|----------|------|
| Operating System | [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) |
| Provisioning Tools | [NixOps](https://github.com/NixOS/nixops) & [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) |
| Service Discovery | [Consul](https://www.consul.io/) |
| Container Orchestration | [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/) |
| Storage Backend | [TrueNAS](https://www.truenas.com/) |

The network is managed declaratively by a Raspberry Pi 3 configured to act as a router (see [here](./machines/hosts/viki/default.nix) and [here](./machines/services/router.nix)).

Most of this is automated, but without good Terraform providers for TrueNAS, the file server is still managed manually.

## Structure

- `machines/`: provisions physical resources & manages operating systems
  - `hosts/`: host-level configuration
  - `hardware/`: settings for different hardware classes (e.g. Raspberry Pi)
- `infrastructure/`: higher-level terraform configs and service definitions
